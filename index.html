        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone
          languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to
          create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which
          work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages
          on the web.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The head</b> element contains information about the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the
            user
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>section</b> elements are semantic elements that define a section
            in a document that contains thematic content
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The footer</b> appears at the bottom of the page and usually
            contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation
          </li>

        <p>
          Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of
          each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
          GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track
          of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using
          GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily
          collaborate with others.
        </p>
        <h3>Git cammands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>
            git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it
          </li>
          <li>git Add -A: Add the change to be commited</li>
          <li>
            git commit -m "": commit the chang to be pushed, m stands for
            message
          </li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulled the changes from the main branch</li>
          <li>git push: pushed the change to github</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to create a new branch</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You should be in main, if not switch to main branch
            <q
              ><i><b>git checkout main</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull down the latest main branch
            <q
              ><i><b>git pull origin main</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Checkout main branch and create a new branch
            <q
              ><i><b>Git checkout -b feature/name of the branch</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify you are in the new branch
            <q
              ><i><b>git status</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the project in VS Code if it is not open
            <q
              ><i><b>Code .</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <span
            >After making changes the follwing steps will be for pushing the
            branch to GitHub</span
          >

          <li>
            to see the changes run
            <q
              ><i><b>git status</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            to add the change to a commit
            <q
              ><i><b>git add -A</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            to commit the change
            <q
              ><i><b></b></i>git commit -m "type your message here"</q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            before you commit you should pull the changes from the main to avoid
            conflicts
            <q
              ><i><b>git pull origin main</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            to push the changes you made to your branch
            <q
              ><i><b>git push origin feature/name-of-your-branch</b></i></q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the GitHub repo in the browser, where the main branch is
            displayed by default. Select the branch feature/starter-code from
            the dropdown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the "Pull Requests" tab at the top, as shown in the following
            image
          </li>
          <li>
            Once on the pull requests page, find and click the "New pull
            request" button
          </li>
          <li>
            Now we need to compare the two branches that we want to merge. The
            base branch that we want to merge into should come first. In our
            case, this is the main branch. We want to merge our
            feature/your-name-branch, so that is our compare branch.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short
            description of the changes
          </li>
          <li>Next, select the "Create Pull Request" button to make your PR</li>
          <li>
            In the workplace and when working collaboratively as a team, once a
            PR has been created, we would request that one or two other team
            members review the code before it is merged into the base branch.
          </li>
          <li>
            if your PR reviwed and approved It is time to merge our new feature
            into our main codebase! Click the "Merge pull request" button and
            confirm
          </li>
          <li>
            Let's make sure that we close our HTML issue on GitHub since we have
            merged in the feature associated with it. Navigate to the "Issues"
            tab on GitHub
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on the issue that was completed then clik the
            <q>Close issue</q>
          </li>
          <span
            ><b>Note:</b>Always update your local repository with the changes
            that we made to the main one in Github and state current to avoid
            conflics: this are the command you will use assuming the main is the
            base repo</span
          >
          <pre>
            git checkout main
